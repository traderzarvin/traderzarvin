## 👋 About Me

I'm a creative director who lives at the intersection of design and code. Currently leading the creative vision at shopquik, where I blend aesthetics with functionality to create digital experiences that don't just look good—they feel right. My approach is simple: get 1% better every day, because small consistent improvements compound into extraordinary results.

I believe the best digital products are born when creativity meets technical execution. That's why I don't just design interfaces—I build them. From concept to code, I'm hands-on with every pixel and every line, ensuring that what we envision is exactly what users experience.

My playground spans across Adobe's creative suite for design work, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for bringing those designs to life on the web. I'm passionate about creating interfaces that are not only visually stunning but also intuitive, accessible, and performant. Whether it's crafting a brand identity or architecting a responsive layout, I approach each project with the same dedication to excellence.

When I'm not pushing pixels or writing code, you'll find me somewhere in the internet—exploring new design trends, experimenting with emerging web technologies, and contributing to the open-source community. I'm always learning, always building, and always looking for ways to bridge the gap between what's beautiful and what's possible.
